You have been linked to this form because you have been chosen by one of our prospective DTS students as a personal reference contact. 

The YWAM Discipleship Training School (DTS) is an intensive Christian training course beginning with an 11 or 12- week lecture/teaching phase followed by an 8 to 12-week practical field assignment. It is designed to encourage students in personal character development, to deepen a living relationship with God and to identify their unique individual gifts and callings in God. 

If you have time, it would be much appreciated if you could fill out this form about the applicant to the best of your ability. It will help us get to know them better, and to see if they will be a good fit for one of our schools here in Sendai, Japan. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to fill out this reference form! We really appreciate your cooperation and assistance.

If you are unable to fill in this form for whatever reason, please reply to the email this form was sent via and let us know so that we can find a suitable replacement. Thank you!
