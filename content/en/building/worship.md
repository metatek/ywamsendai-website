We desire a place dedicated to worship, prayer and intercession. A place were we as YWAMers can go to anytime to pray both individually as with others. We also want to start hosting regular worship and prayer times open to the public, where local people can come to be themselves and to encounter the love of Christ.

Currently, we meet in each other's homes to pray and to worship at set times. As our team grows, we would like to have a larger space that is available anytime. We also have been unable to host public worship and prayer times due to the lack of a facility.
