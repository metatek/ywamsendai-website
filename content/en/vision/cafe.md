We would like to establish a physical space where people can come and be themselves. To leave their worries at the door and to truly relax. Whether students worried about exams, young mothers worried about raising their children, or the elderly simply needing a place to sit with friendly faces. We want to create an atmosphere of peace and joy, inviting the Holy Spirit to minister to people's hearts.

We also want to run events to bring moments of fun and laughter to people--encouraging new friendships to be birthed. Live music, language practice, international culture nights, video game nights, arts and craft sessions, and informal invitation to times of prayer and Bible study. 

Right now, we have taken a step in this direction by establishing a food truck called Kokoro Kitchen. "Kokoro" means "heart" in Japanese. The hope is that we can connect with local people in a natural way, and give us experience in serving in this way. But we do hope to have a physical space to better facilitate all we envision.

Needs:

- A facility!
- People with skills, experiences and/or vision for a cafe / community centre
- Finances to get started
