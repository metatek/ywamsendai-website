We desire to have a place to host events to invite the local community to. Events that will help us to make friends and connections, with the hope of drawing people to know Jesus.

Here are some events we would like to host:

* Christmas/New Year outreach
* Easter outreach
* Video game nights with young people
* Mother and baby groups
* Language and/or culture events (great for visiting teams!)

Up to now, it has been difficult to host these kinds of events due to not having easy access to local facilities.
