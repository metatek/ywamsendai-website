We desire to have a place to call our home as a YWAM community. A place where YWAMers can live together in an atmosphere of worship and prayer. A place to rest, and a place to dream.

Currently, we all live and meet in our own individual homes. But we are starting to run out of space as our team grows! We need a place to centre ourselves: whether for worship and prayer, ministry, events, or just hanging out.
