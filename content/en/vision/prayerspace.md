We would like to establish a space dedicated to prayer. A place with no distractions, where people can forget about the cares of the world and focus on God and be filled with His presence. This would be open to anyone, including local missionaries, pastors, believers, and even not-yet-believers who have a desire to pray to the unknown God who made them.

This could be a prayer garden, a small prayer room, a large prayer room, or even a whole house!

Needs:

- A facility!
- Finances to furnish and maintain it
- People with a passion for prayer and a desire to see others go deeper with God
- Creatives and artists to help encourage people to focus on God
