We would like to establish a place where guests can come and find rest. This can include visitors from overseas, outreach teams, visiting family and friends, short-term missionaries, or even locals who need a safe place to stay.

We receive enquiries from outreach teams and volunteers who seek places to stay in Sendai so they can visit and minister to the people here. But we don't have our own place to house them! Up to now, we have partnered with a local seminary and a church to host people when available, although we sometimes have to turn people down. We would love to host people ourselves.

Needs:

- A facility! The more rooms the better!
- Finances to furnish and maintain it, and to keep costs low for visitors
- People with a heart/skills for hospitality
