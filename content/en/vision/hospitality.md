We desire a place where short-term visitors, volunteers, teams, friends, and family members from both within and outside Japan can come and stay with us!

We value hospitality and want to create a comfortable environment for people to stay and to rest. We love having people come visit us in Sendai!

Up until now, it has been difficult for us to comfortably host people. We either cram people on a futon in a living room, or have them stay in an inconvenient location. We have also had to decline people from coming! :(
