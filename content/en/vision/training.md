We desire a place where people can receive training to know God and to make Him known.

We want to see Japanese people come to Sendai to be trained to be sent out all over the world, or to make God known here in their own country. We also want to see people from all over the world come to Sendai to be trained to reach the Japanese people specifically, as well as people all over the world.

A few of the schools we want to see established here include:
- Discipleship Training School
- School of Biblical Studies
- School of Frontier Missions

We really need a facility to be able to house students and to have lectures!
