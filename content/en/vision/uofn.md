We would like to establish different schools registered with YWAMÅfs University of the Nations that will help train and equip people to know God and to make Him known! We want to see people come to Sendai to go deeper with God, to find GodÅfs calling for their lives, to be equipped to make disciples, and to send them out to pioneer new works all over Tohoku, Japan, and the world--both Japanese and international students.

A few of the schools we want to see established here include:

- Discipleship Training School (DTS)
- School of Biblical Studies (SBS)
- School of [Frontier] Missions (SO[F]M)

In order to run schools, we need a facility or facilities to host students and visiting speakers, lecture space(s), kitchen and dining hall, and space for worship and prayer.

Needs:

- Facilities!
- Finances to furnish and maintain them
- School leaders
- School staff
- Kitchen staff
- Administration staff
- Accountants
- Worship leaders
