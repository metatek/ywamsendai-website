We would like to establish a Christian community that is connected 24/7. This is a community that includes both physical and online expression. It is an online-native Christian community, where people meet together physically, organically, out of a desire to be together rather than being obligated because of our definition of "church."

The reasons for the connectedness are many. Some include:

- Younger generations are connected with each other at all times. Community without this today is arguably no community at all.
- Sometimes we need prayer or encouragement randomly throughout the day/week.
- Those with social anxiety (including the *hikikomori*) find it hard to be in large groups, yet still long for community.
- Those with busy schedules (common in Japan) find it hard to meet with others for worship, prayer, or even fellowship.

This community would be especially welcome to:

- Local believers looking for a Christian community/church
- Believers already connected to a church, but desire a 24/7 online community element
- Those new to Christianity and wanting to find out more (or just attracted to the community!)

Of course, the desire is not to keep the community limited to online. We want to encourage regular physical meet-ups for prayer, worship, Bible study, discipleship, evangelism, outreach trips, and fun!

Note: Since putting words to this vision, COVID happened! Churches all over the world moved their church services online. While there have been benefits with this, there have been other negative consequences. Primarily, it has facilitated a form of "church" without the fellowship. Something that one can watch or experience, whether live or recorded. This is not what we are envisioning here! (Not centred around a streamed weekly "church service" for example)

Needs:

- People with experience with online community
- People with experience with discipleship and/church planting (and willing to try new things!)
