We would like to establish a programme to assist foreign missionaries effectively acquire the Japanese language and culture, as well as to help Japanese people acquire English for the sake of being a missionary overseas or working with foreigners within Japan.

Currently, each foreign missionary with YWAM Sendai needs to find their own path and plan for acquiring the Japanese language. While some enjoy this freedom, others would benefit from more guidance at an affordable rate. We would like to make the transition into Japan for foreigners as smooth as possible.

Needs:

- People with experience with helping others acquire a foreign language (especially Japanese or English)
